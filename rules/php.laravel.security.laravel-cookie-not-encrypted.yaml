message: The application appears to have disabled the cookie encryption middleware
  which can lead to a Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. If the application
  uses cookie-based authentication, an attacker can trick users into sending authenticated
  HTTP requests without their knowledge from any arbitrary domain they visit. You
  can prevent this vulnerability by encrypting cookies if you use them to handle sessions
  or storing sensitive data. To enable the cookie encryption middleware add `\$APP\Http\Middleware\EncryptCookies`
  to the middleware group in your `$APP\Http\Kernel` class.
