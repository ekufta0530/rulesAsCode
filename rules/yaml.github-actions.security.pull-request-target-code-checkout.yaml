message: This GitHub Actions workflow file uses `pull_request_target` and checks out
  code from the incoming pull request. When using `pull_request_target`, the Action
  runs in the context of the target repository, which includes access to all repository
  secrets. Normally, this is safe because the Action only runs code from the target
  repository, not the incoming PR. However, by checking out the incoming PR code,
  you're now using the incoming code for the rest of the action. You may be inadvertently
  executing arbitrary code from the incoming PR with access to repository secrets,
  which would let an attacker steal repository secrets. This normally happens by running
  build scripts (e.g., `npm build` and `make`) or dependency installation scripts
  (e.g., `python setup.py install`). Audit your workflow file to make sure no code
  from the incoming PR is executed. Please see https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/
  for additional mitigations.
