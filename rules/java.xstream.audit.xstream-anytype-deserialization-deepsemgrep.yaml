message: 'The application may convert user-controlled data into an object, which can
  lead to an insecure deserialization vulnerability. An attacker can create a malicious
  serialized object, pass it to the application, and take advantage of the deserialization
  process to perform Denial-of-service (DoS), Remote code execution (RCE), or bypass
  access control measures. To prevent this vulnerability, leverage data formats such
  as JSON or XML as safer alternatives. If you need to deserialize user input in a
  specific format, consider digitally signing the data before serialization to prevent
  tampering. For more information, see: [Deserialization prevention](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Deserialization_Cheat_Sheet.html)
  We do not recommend deserializing untrusted data with the `XStream` unless you explicitly
  define permissions for types that are allowed to be deserialized by `XStream`.'
