message: 'Elixir provides the concept of truthiness: nil and false are considered
  "falsy" and all other values are "truthy". Many constructs in the language, such
  as `&&/2`, `||/2`, and `!/1` handle truthy and falsy values. Using those operators
  is not an anti-pattern. However, using those operators when all operands are expected
  to be booleans, may be an anti-pattern and could lead to undefined behavior.'
