message: 'Found object deserialization using ObjectInputStream. Deserializing entire
  Java objects is dangerous because malicious actors can create Java object streams
  with unintended consequences. Ensure that the objects being deserialized are not
  user-controlled. Consider using HMACs to sign the data stream to make sure it is
  not tampered with, or consider only  transmitting object fields and populating a
  new object.
