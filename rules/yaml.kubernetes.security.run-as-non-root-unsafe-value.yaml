message: When running containers in Kubernetes, it's important to ensure that they  are
  properly secured to prevent privilege escalation attacks.  One potential vulnerability
  is when a container is allowed to run  applications as the root user, which could
  allow an attacker to gain  access to sensitive resources. To mitigate this risk,
  it's recommended to  add a `securityContext` to the container, with the parameter
  `runAsNonRoot`  set to `true`. This will ensure that the container runs as a non-root
  user,  limiting the damage that could be caused by any potential attacks. By  adding
  a `securityContext` to the container in your Kubernetes pod, you can  help to ensure
  that your containerized applications are more secure and  less vulnerable to privilege
  escalation attacks.
