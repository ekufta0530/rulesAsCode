  help: '## Remediation

    Session manipulation can occur when an application allows user-input in session
    keys. Since sessions are typically considered a source of truth (e.g. to check
    the logged-in user or to match CSRF tokens), allowing an attacker to manipulate
    the session may lead to unintended behavior.
