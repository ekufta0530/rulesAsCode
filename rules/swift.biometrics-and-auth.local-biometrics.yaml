id: swift.biometrics-and-auth.local-biometrics.insecure-biometrics
message: The application was observed to leverage biometrics via Local Authentication,
  which returns a simple boolean result for authentication. This design is subject
  to bypass with runtime tampering tools such as Frida, Substrate, and others. Although
  this is limited to rooted (jailbroken) devices, consider implementing biometric
  authentication the reliable way - via Keychain Services.
