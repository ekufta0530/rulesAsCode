id: swift.biometrics-and-auth.no-verify.verify-biometric-changes
message: The application was observed to leverage biometrics, without verifying that
  biometric changes have not taken place. Failure to do so means that an attacker
  with knowledge of the victim's passcode or the ability to guess the passcode - can
  register their own biometrics, and bypass the authentication mechanism within the
  app. The application should check first that biometric changes have not been made,
  then proceed.
