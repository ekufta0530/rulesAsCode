  message: By default, the AWS Lambda Environment is encrypted using AWS-managed keys.
    However, for added security, it's recommended to configure your own AWS KMS encryption
    key to protect your environment variables in Lambda. You can either create a new
    aws_kms_key resource or use the ARN of an existing key in your AWS account to
    do so.
