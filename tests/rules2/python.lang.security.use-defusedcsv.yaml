  message: Detected the generation of a CSV file using the built-in `csv` module.
    If user data is used to generate the data in this file, it is possible that an
    attacker could inject a formula when the CSV is imported into a spreadsheet application
    that runs an attacker script, which could steal data from the importing user or,
    at worst, install malware on the user's computer. `defusedcsv` is a drop-in replacement
    with the same API that will attempt to mitigate formula injection attempts. You
    can use `defusedcsv` instead of `csv` to safely generate CSVs.
