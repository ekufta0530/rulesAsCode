  severity: WARNING
  message: 'Conditions for Nginx H2C smuggling identified. H2C smuggling allows upgrading
    HTTP/1.1 connections to lesser-known HTTP/2 over cleartext (h2c) connections which
    can allow a bypass of reverse proxy access controls, and lead to long-lived, unrestricted
    HTTP traffic directly to back-end servers. To mitigate: WebSocket support required:
    Allow only the value websocket for HTTP/1.1 upgrade headers (e.g., Upgrade: websocket).
    WebSocket support not required: Do not forward Upgrade headers.'
