  message: If a dynamic query must be used,leverage nFORCE Query Builder. In other
    programming languages, the related flaw is known as SQL injection. Apex doesn't
    use SQL, but uses its own database query language, SOQL. SOQL is much simpler
    and more limited in functionality than SQL. The risks are much lower for SOQL
    injection than for SQL injection, but the attacks are nearly identical to traditional
    SQL injection. SQL/SOQL injection takes user-supplied input and uses those values
    in a dynamic SOQL query. If the input isn't validated, it can include SOQL commands
    that effectively modify the SOQL statement and trick the application into performing
    unintended commands.
