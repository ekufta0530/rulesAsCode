  message: A hard-coded credential was detected. It is not recommended to store credentials
    in source-code, as this risks secrets being leaked and used by either an internal
    or external malicious adversary. It is recommended to use environment variables
    to securely provide credentials or retrieve credentials from a secure vault or
    HSM (Hardware Security Module).
