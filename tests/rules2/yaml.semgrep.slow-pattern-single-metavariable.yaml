  message: Using a single metavariable as a pattern drastically slows down the rule
    performance because it will match every expression in a file. Instead, try to
    match something specific such as a function name, or anchor on a statement that
    may occur above or below the pattern. The more specific you can be, the faster
    the pattern will run.
