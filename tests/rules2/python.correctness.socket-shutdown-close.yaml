  message: Socket is not closed if shutdown fails. When socket.shutdown fails on an
    OSError, socket.close is not called and the code fails to clean up the socket
    and allow garbage collection to release the memory used for it. The OSError on
    shutdown can occur when the remote side of the connection closes the connection
    first.
