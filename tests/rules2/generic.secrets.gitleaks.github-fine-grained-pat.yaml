  message: A gitleaks github-fine-grained-pat was detected which attempts to identify
    hard-coded credentials. It is not recommended to store credentials in source-code,
    as this risks secrets being leaked and used by either an internal or external
    malicious adversary. It is recommended to use environment variables to securely
    provide credentials or retrieve credentials from a secure vault or HSM (Hardware
    Security Module).
