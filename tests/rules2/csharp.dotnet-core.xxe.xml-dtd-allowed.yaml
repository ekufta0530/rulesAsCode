  message: The application is using an XML parser that has not been safely configured.
    This might lead to XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities when parsing user-controlled
    input. An attacker can include document type definitions (DTDs) or XIncludes which
    can interact with internal or external hosts. XXE can lead to other vulnerabilities,
    such as Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote Code Execution (RCE), and Server-side
    request forgery (SSRF), depending on the application configuration. An attacker
    can also use DTDs to expand recursively, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS)
    attack, also known as a `Billion Laughs Attack`. The best defense against XXE
    is to have an XML parser that supports disabling DTDs. Limiting the use of external
    entities from the start can prevent the parser from being used to process untrusted
    XML files. Reducing dependencies on external resources is also a good practice
    for performance reasons. It is difficult to guarantee that even a trusted XML
    file on your server or during transmission has not been tampered with by a malicious
    third-party.
