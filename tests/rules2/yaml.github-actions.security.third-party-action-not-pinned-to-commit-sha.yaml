  message: An action sourced from a third-party repository on GitHub is not pinned
    to a full length commit SHA. Pinning an action to a full length commit SHA is
    currently the only way to use an action as an immutable release. Pinning to a
    particular SHA helps mitigate the risk of a bad actor adding a backdoor to the
    action's repository, as they would need to generate a SHA-1 collision for a valid
    Git object payload.
