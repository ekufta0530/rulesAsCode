  message: Detected a potentially dynamic ClientTrace. This occurred because semgrep
    could not find a static definition for '$TRACE'. Dynamic ClientTraces are dangerous
    because they deserialize function code to run when certain Request events occur,
    which could lead to code being run without your knowledge. Ensure that your ClientTrace
    is statically defined.
