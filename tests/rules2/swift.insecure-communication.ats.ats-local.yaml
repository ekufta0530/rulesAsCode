  message: The application's App Transport Security (ATS) configuration allows for
    local networking, which in some iOS versions is blocked by default in ATS. Consider
    whether or not the application requires this in release builds, or for development
    reasons only. This follows the principle of least privelege, reducing the attack
    surface if local networking is not required.
