  message: Spring Boot Actuator is fully enabled. This exposes sensitive endpoints
    such as /actuator/env, /actuator/logfile, /actuator/heapdump and others. Unless
    you have Spring Security enabled or another means to protect these endpoints,
    this functionality is available without authentication, causing a severe security
    risk.
