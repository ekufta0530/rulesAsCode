  message: When using the AWS Lambda "Image" package_type, `runtime` and `handler`
    are not necessary for Lambda to understand how to run the code. These are built
    into the container image. Including `runtime` or `handler` with an "Image" `package_type`
    will result in an error on `terraform apply`. Remove these redundant fields.
