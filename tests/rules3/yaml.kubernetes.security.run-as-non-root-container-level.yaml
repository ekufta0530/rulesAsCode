  message: When running containers in Kubernetes, it's important to ensure that they
    are properly secured to prevent privilege escalation attacks. One potential vulnerability
    is when a container is allowed to run applications as the root user, which could
    allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive resources. To mitigate this risk,
    it's recommended to add a `securityContext` to the container, with the parameter
    `runAsNonRoot` set to `true`. This will ensure that the container runs as a non-root
    user, limiting the damage that could be caused by any potential attacks. By adding
    a `securityContext` to the container in your Kubernetes pod, you can help to ensure
    that your containerized applications are more secure and less vulnerable to privilege
    escalation attacks.
